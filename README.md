# CSE 332 Project 3

The purpose of this project is to get familiar with writing sequential code and using parallelism to potentially speed up that code. You will be using the ForkJoin framework to achieve parallelism.

You will implement Parser (in main/), as well as OutSequential, OutParallelBad, OutParallelLock, and InParallel (in solvers/). You will also need to implement ArrayCopyTask, RelaxOutTaskBad, RelaxOutTaskLock, and RelaxInTask (in paralleltasks/) which are used in the parallel query responders.
